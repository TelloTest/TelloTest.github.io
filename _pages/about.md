Tello- is the online handle of Joshua Lollis. He moved from Wisconsin to California in 2013, in order to make his Game Development dreams more than a virtual reality. Josh is a junior at California State University: Fullerton where he is seeking his B.S. in Computer Science. He has an A.S. in Computer Science as well as an A.A. in Interdisciplinary Math & Science. Josh has been attending school consistently for ~6 years. He is a student by hobby and profession. For 6 years he worked full-time alongside his schooling, but he is now spending full-time on schoolwork and his own independent game development. School has been a long journey, but the light at the end of the tunnel draws closer. However, he doesn't doubt he will continue his education further because he enjoys being in that setting.

Ok, enough 3rd person crap...

Hi! I'm Tello-(Josh). I moved to California in order to live in a major cultural hub and to surround myself with people that had a passion for... anything. The small town I come from isn't a place you usually find driven, passionate people. By small, I mean <9k people. I outgrew my roots and sold anything that wouldn't fit in my car to move cross-country. I drove 28 hours(14 hours each over 2 days) in my little Saturn Ion packed like a tuna can, floor to ceiling, front to back. 

Much to my surprise, many of my friends and family doubted my chances of success. They outright told me it was a bad idea and that I'd fail only to be back in 6 months. I've now been in California for 8 years. I've been married for 3 years, share a condo with my beautiful wife and now have a couple of Associate degrees to boot. I have made roots in California with no looking back. When I want something, and when I'm doubted, I strive even harder to make things happen. It's who I am at my core.

I went through a lot of struggle, reflection, growth and advice to become who I am today. I have evolved so greatly since being diagnosed with ADHD in my mid 20's. My wife and I discovered what it was together and realized it was something I may have. I felt relieved for the first time in my life to understand who and why I was, who I was.  I have since grown into my Neuro-Divergence and continue to grow daily. 

I am proud of who I am. I have come to terms with what I am dealing with and know how to deal with it well. That being said, I wasn't always vocal about it. In recent years I've become very vocal about my ADHD and its friend, depression. I think it's beneficial for people to know that others very near to them deal with this stuff. It's not uncommon for a person to deal with some kind of mental situation. It is, however, uncommon for people to talk about it openly. I make it a point to talk about my experiences in order to help others share their experiences or seek help if they feel so inclined. Putting in the effort of my personal growth saved my life and is leading me to meet my true potential. Growing into my ADHD-self and all the rest of what I'm made from, has forged me into a hardworking powerhouse creator. I am able to formulate ideas rapidly and utilize my hyperfocus to get projects done successfully. I want to see other people find success with their situations like I have.

I love to create. Creation is the core of who I am. I've played guitar/bass for ~20 years. I am an artist. I enjoy working in pencil, pen, watercolor, marker and digital mediums. Digitally I have enjoyed creating both raster and vector images. I have some history as a graphic design major as well as a brief stint in guitar building (luthiery). I love to write. From childhood, I've dreamed of creating a world as rich and robust as to rival the Marvel Universe, Middle Earth or the Star Wars universe (Galaxy?)...

My ultimate goal is to bring my interests together to form one career. I am a fan of Leonardo DaVinci. I like to study his life, writings, and drawings in order to find the mindset of a multi-faceted creator. Da Vinci is commonly referred to as a Polymath. A Polymath is someone who is masterful at many areas of interest. My aim is to be a modern polymath much like Da Vinci was in his time.  Conveniently for me... Art, Guitar, Programming and Writing all coalesce into the *Creation* of video games. And as I've said, creation is at the core of who I am.

I mentioned previously that I love school and love to learn. I believe that you shouldn't wait for school to teach you something in order to learn it. In fact, I believe the opposite is true. I think it's best to dive in and learn on your own, and then check yourself against what you've learned at school. I enjoy challenging the knowledge of my teachers, while also absorbing everything they can teach me. I think this is the way you cement your knowledge, learn to think critically, and **learn how to learn**, instead of how to pass tests. 

I believe in public failure as a teaching method. In my perspective, any creative community could benefit from more transparency in the creation process. Polished final products don't just form from the fingertips in an instant. Creation is a winding, dirty road filled with potholes. It's not until we travel down this road, failing, and failing again along the way, that something truly great is created.

Please, feel free to email me your story, any questions about ADHD, my experiences or my story. I am also always open for constructive feedback on my work, whether that be the writing of this long-winded about-me, my art or my creations of any kind.

Thank you for spending the time to read about me.
