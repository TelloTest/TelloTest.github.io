Service and leadership
======

I created a group for STEM students to rely on each other for important updates, information and guidance. I invite a couple people I meet in my classes each semester to join us. I usually invite people that I've noticed displaying a passion for learning or their future. Members that were once strangers have even made connections with each other outside of the group. I'm trying to cultivate a place where we have each other's best interest at heart. A place where we will go out of the way for one another to help each other be successful in our STEM careers. The hope is to cultivate friendships outside of myself and to foster the growth of future partnerships among the members of my group.

Clubs
=====

I spent a semester as a member of the project RAISE transfer program at CSUF. RAISE is a program at CSUF focused on STEM students who have transferred in to CSUF. While in the club, I attended zoom workshops about anything from stress management to game nights. This was during Covid-19 so we never got to have a meeting in person. Being in this club allowed me to meet new people in the solitude of the Covid-19 pandemic. I invited some of the people I met in the program to the group I built. Some of these people signed up for future classes with me and some of the members even connected outside of my participation. It was a great oppurtunity for networking and a little bit of sanity during Covid-19 remote learning.
